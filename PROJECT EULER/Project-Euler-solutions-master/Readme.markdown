Project Euler solutions
=======================

This package contains Nayuki's program code to solve 188 or more Project Euler problems.

Each solved problem has a program written in Java. Additionally, some solutions have
Python, Mathematica, and/or Haskell programs. Some solutions include a detailed
mathematical explanation/proof in the source code to justify the program logic.

All problems from #1 to #100 have a Java program, and #1 to #50 have Python and Mathematica programs.
The project codebase contains at least 185 solutions in Java, at least 150 in Python,
at least 120 in Mathematica, and at least 65 in Haskell.

Java solutions require JDK 5 or above. Python solutions are tested to work on CPython 2.7.10 and 3.4.3. Mathematica solutions are tested to work on Mathematica 5.1.
